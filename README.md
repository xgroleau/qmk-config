# Qmk-configs
My qmk configuration. Uses [nix](https://nixos.org/) to build and flash the firmware.

The configurations are generated by [qmk online tool](https://config.qmk.fm).

## Flash
To flash, simply run `nix run .#$KEYBOARD` where `$KEYBOARD` is the desired keyboard.
Or you can manually use qmk command line if you use `nix develop`.
